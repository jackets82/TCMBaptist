        The Lord Jesus committed two ordinances to the church as permanent
        practices: The Lord’s Supper and baptism (Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 2:38-42;
        1 Cor. 11:23-26).
        <br />
        <br />
        Baptism is a visible symbol of God’s saving work within a person. It is
        a solemn and beautiful testimony of a believer who has been saved by
        grace from the judgment for sin (Rom. 3:23; 6:23). It publicly declares
        that those who have repented and put their faith in Jesus Christ gladly
        identify with the Lord Jesus, the Head of the Church, and his body.
        (Acts 2:37-39; Rom. 6:1-3). All who have repented of sins and believed
        on Christ alone for salvation should be baptised by immersion.
        <br />
        <br />
        As TCM Baptist Church, we are convinced by Scripture that biblical
        baptism is commanded of all believers (Matt. 28:19-20). We are also
        convinced that biblical baptism is only for believers: those who have
        repented of their sin and trusted in the Lord Jesus. Since infants and
        young children are unable to understand this, the church did not widely
        practice baptism of infants until the third century.
        <br />
        <br />
        Further, we understand that biblical baptism is by immersion because
        “baptise” comes from a word that means to immerse. Immersion also
        reenacts what happened at salvation. When the believer is immersed into
        water, he is showing that in Christ he died to sin and buried the old
        self. When he comes out of the water, he is showing that in Christ, he
        is spiritually alive, a new creation (Rom. 6:4, 10). This is why
        immersion was chosen as the mode of baptism.
        <br />
        <br />
        When a believer is baptised, he testifies through his action that his
        faith is in the crucified, buried, and risen Saviour. Biblical baptism
        demonstrates union with the Lord Jesus in death to sin and resurrection
        to a new life (Rom. 6:1-11). Not only does it put the internal reality
        of salvation on display in the physical world, it is also a sign of
        fellowship and identification with the visible Body of Christ (Acts
        2:41-42).
