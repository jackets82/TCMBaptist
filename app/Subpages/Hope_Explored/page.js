            Hope Explored looks at the life, death and resurrection of Jesus in
            Lukeâ€™s Gospel, this three-session series shows that Christianity is
            about real hope: a joyful expectation for the future, based on true
            events in the past, which changes everything about my present.{" "}
            <br />
            <br /> Hope Explored does not require a huge time commitment from
            guests and is one of the easiest ways to introduce someone to
            Christianity. The Christianity Explored series can then be run as a
            follow-up course for those eager to explore the Christian faith
            more.
